# GLIA — Glycemic Artificial Intelligence System
Public Technical Showcase Repository

IMPORTANT NOTICE — PLEASE READ FIRST

This repository does not contain the full GLIA system.

The system demonstrated here represents only a small, intentionally simplified fraction of the actual GLIA project.
The real system is orders of magnitude more complex, both in architecture and decision logic, and is therefore not publicly exposed.

This repository exists strictly as a technical showcase — a curated, public-facing layer designed to demonstrate engineering reasoning, modeling strategies, and system design choices, without revealing proprietary logic, sensitive data, or full implementation details.

PROJECT OVERVIEW

GLIA (Glycemic Artificial Intelligence System) is an applied Artificial Intelligence project focused on non-invasive glucose intelligence.

The project investigates how AI systems can extract meaningful glycemic behavior from non-invasive physiological signals under conditions of noise, uncertainty, and strong biological variability.

GLIA is built around three tightly connected research and engineering fronts:

Improving the accuracy of non-invasive glucose estimation

Predicting short-term future glucose levels (up to 60 minutes ahead)

Generating adaptive dietary recommendations driven by real-time and predicted glycemic states

Rather than treating these as isolated problems, GLIA approaches them as parts of a single intelligent metabolic system.

PROJECT ORIGIN

GLIA originated in July 2025 as a technical school project within a formal Artificial Intelligence program.

What started as an academic requirement quickly evolved into a long-term, hands-on applied research project, driven by continuous experimentation, model iteration, and system redesign.

Since its inception, GLIA has been:

Actively developed

Iteratively refined

Expanded well beyond its original academic scope

Development is ongoing to this day.

CORE OBJECTIVES

GLIA explores how AI systems can:

Enhance the reliability of non-invasive glucose measurements

Model short-horizon glycemic dynamics in real time

Adapt nutritional recommendations dynamically, based on current and projected metabolic conditions

The project prioritizes system-level intelligence over isolated model performance, emphasizing:

Temporal coherence

Physiological plausibility

Robustness to noisy signals

Controlled decision-making under uncertainty

WHAT THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS

This public repository exposes only a demonstrative subset of the GLIA project, including:

Structured preprocessing of physiological time-series data

Extensive feature engineering (temporal, metabolic, and bioimpedance-oriented)

Short-horizon glucose prediction pipelines (5–60 minutes ahead)

A demonstration of glycemia-driven dietary generation logic

Reproducible experimentation flows for technical and academic evaluation

All components were intentionally designed to be:

Reviewable

Safe for public release

Representative of the underlying engineering and reasoning approach

WHAT IS INTENTIONALLY NOT INCLUDED

To preserve intellectual property, safety constraints, and research integrity, this repository does not include:

Real or identifiable patient data

Full system architecture or orchestration logic

Advanced personalization and calibration strategies

Clinical-grade decision rules

Deployment, monitoring, or safety enforcement layers

This separation is deliberate by design, not a limitation of the project.

ON THE REAL COMPLEXITY OF GLIA

GLIA is not a single model, script, or pipeline.

The real system involves:

Multiple interacting learning components

Temporal dependency modeling across different time horizons

Adaptive logic conditioned on individual metabolic behavior

Uncertainty-aware prediction and decision layers

Strict physiological and safety boundary enforcement

This repository exists to show how the system is thought and built — not to expose everything it contains.
